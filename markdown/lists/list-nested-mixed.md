1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.

    Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.
  
    If you do _make a mess_, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.

    Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter.

    By "vigorous," we mean a strictly vertical motion. Julia Child once quipped:

    * Use both hands
    * Always have a towel nearby in case of messes
